Artificial Intelligence
Intelligence
Mental quality that consists of the abilities to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one’s environment.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence simply means technology that can make machines think like human beings and they can work the way we humans do. It assists robots to copy the activity of humans based on their behaviour and it is used in almost every area such as the healthcare industry, cartoons and animation, media industry, and so on. 
AI Perspective
While some people describe intelligence in terms of fidelity to human performance, others prefer the formal, abstract definition of intelligence known as rationality, or, more generally put, acting in accordance with morality. The topic itself varies as well; some view intelligence as a quality of interior thought and reasoning, while others place more emphasis on intelligent action, an exterior characteristic.
From these two dimensions—human vs. rational and thought vs. behavior, there are four possible combinations
Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
Thinking rationally: The “laws of thought” approach
 Acting Humanly
The first proposal for success in building a program and acts humanly was the Turing Test. To be considered intelligent a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator. A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously. If after a reasonable period, the interrogator cannot tell which is which, the program passes.
To pass this test requires:
•	natural language processing processing to communicate successfully in a human language
•	knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears
•	automated reasoning  to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
•	machine learning  to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
•	This test avoids physical contact and concentrates on "higher level" mental faculties. A total Turing test would require the program to also do:
•	computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world
•	robotics to manipulate the object and move about
Thinking Humanly
This requires "getting inside" of the human mind to see how it works and then comparing our computer programs to this. This is what cognitive science attempts to do. Another way to do this is to observe a human problem solving and argue that one's programs go about problem solving in a similar way.
We can learn about human thought in three ways:
introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by;
psychological experiments—observing a person in action;
brain imaging—observing the brain in action.
Example: GPS (General Problem Solver) was an early computer program that attempted to model human thinking. The developers were not so much interested in whether or not GPS solved problems correctly. They were more interested in showing that it solved problems like people, going through the same steps and taking around the same amount of time to perform those steps.
Thinking Rationally
Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify "thinking". His syllogisms provided patterns of argument structure that always gave correct conclusions, giving correct premises.
Example: All computers use energy. Using energy always generates heat. Therefore, all computers generate heat.
This initiate the field of logic. Formal logic was developed in the late nineteenth century. This was the first step toward enabling computer programs to reason logically.
By 1965, programs existed that could, given enough time and memory, take a description of the problem in logical notation and find the solution, if one existed. The logicist tradition in AI hopes to build on such programs to create intelligence.
There are two main obstacles to this approach: First, it is difficult to make informal knowledge precise enough to use the logicist approach particularly when there is uncertainty in the knowledge. Second, there is a big difference between being able to solve a problem in principle and doing so in practice.
Acting Rationally: The rational agent approach
Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs. An agent is just something that perceives and acts.
In the logical approach to AI, the emphasis is on correct inferences. This is often part of being a rational agent because one way to act rationally is to reason logically and then act on ones conclusions. But this is not all of rationality because agents often find themselves in situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet they must do something.
There are also ways to act rationally that do not seem to involve inference, e.g., reflex actions.
The study of AI as rational agent design has two advantages:
It is more general than the logical approach because correct inference is only a useful mechanism for achieving rationality, not a necessary one.
It is more amenable to scientific development than approaches based on human behaviour or human thought because a standard of rationality can be defined independent of humans.
Achieving perfect rationality in complex environments is not possible because the computational demands are too high. However, we will study perfect rationality as a starting place.

Foundation of AI
Philosophy
AI takes the following ideas from philosophy.
Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusion?
Aristotle (312 – 322 B.C ) was the first to formulate the precise set of laws governing the rational parts of the mind. He developed an informal system of syllogisms for proper reasoning, which in principle allowed one to generate conclusions mechanically given initial premises.
How does the mind arises from a physical brain?
It is one thing to say that mind operates, at least in part, according to logical rules and to build physical system that emulates some of those rules, but it's another thing to say that mind itself is such a physical system.
Where does knowledge from?
Given a physical mind that manipulate knowledge, the next problem is to establish the source of knowledge.
How does knowledge lead to action?
Philosophy tries to answer the connection between knowledge and action. This question is vital to AI because intelligence requires action as well as reasoning.
Mathematics
Philosophers staked out some of the fundamental ideals of AI, but the leap to formal science required a level of mathematical formalization in their fundamental areas:
What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
What can be compute?
How do we reason with uncertain information?
The idea of formal logic can be traced back to the philosophers of ancient Greece, India, and China, but its mathematical development really began with the work of George Boole (1815–1864), who worked out the details of propositional, or Boolean, logic (Boole, 1847).
In 1879, Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) extended Boole’s logic to include objects and relations, creating the first-order logic that is used today.

Economics
AI takes the following ideas from economics.
How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff (utility)?
Decision theory, which combines probability theory. With utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decision made under uncertainty. This is suitable for large “economics” where each agent need pay no attention to the action of the other gent as individuals.
How should we do this when others may not go along?
For small economics, the situation is much more like a game. The action of one player can significantly affect the utility of another. Unlike decision theory game theory does not offer an unambiguous prescription for selecting actions.
How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
For the most part economist did not address this question. This topic was pursed in the field of operation research (OR).
Neuroscience
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, particularly the brain. This study of how brain process information directly help in the development of AI.
Paul Broca’s (1824–1880) investigation of aphasia (speech deficit) in brain-damaged patients in 1861 initiated the study of the brain’s functional organization by identifying a localized area in the left hemisphere—now called Broca’s area—that is responsible for speech production.
By that time, it was known that the brain consisted largely of nerve cells, or neurons, but it was not until 1873 that Camillo Golgi (1843–1926) developed a staining technique allowing the observation of individual neurons .This technique was used by Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934) in his pioneering studies of neuronal organization. It is now widely accepted that cognitive functions result from the electrochemical operation of these structures. That is, a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness. In the pithy words of John Searle (1992), brains cause minds.
Psychology
Psychology tries to answer the following question:
How do humans and animals think and act? 
Modern science proves that computer models could be used to address the psychology of memory, language and logical thinking respectively. It is now common view among psychologist that "a cognitive theory should be like a computer program."
Cognitive psychology, which views the brain as an information-processing device, can be traced back at least to the works of William James (1842–1910). Helmholtz also insisted that perception involved a form of unconscious logical inference. The cognitive viewpoint was largely eclipsed by behaviorism in the United States, but at Cambridge’s Applied Psychology Unit, directed by Frederic Bartlett (1886–1969), cognitive modeling was able to flourish.
Computer Engineering
How can we build an efficient computer?
For AI to succeed, we need two things:
Intelligence and artifact.
The computer has been the artifact of the choice.
The first operational computer was the electromechanical Heath Robinson,9 built in 1943 by Alan Turing’s team for a single purpose: deciphering German messages.In 1943, the same group developed the Colossus, a powerful general-purpose machine based on vacuum tubes. The first operational programmable computer was the Z-3, the invention of Konrad Zuse in Germany in 1941. The first electronic computer, the ABC, was assembled by John Atanasoff and his student Clifford Berry between 1940 and 1942 at Iowa State University.
We are just beginning to see hardware tuned for AI applications, such as the graphics processing unit (GPU), tensor processing unit (TPU), and wafer scale engine (WSE). From the 1960s to about 2012, the amount of computing power used to train top machine learning applications followed Moore’s law. A machine learning model that took a full day to train in 2014 takes only two minutes in 2018 (Ying et al., 2018). Although it is not yet practical, quantum computing holds out the promise of far greater accelerations for some important subclasses of AI algorithms.
Control theory and Cybernetics
How can artifacts operate under their own control?
Control theory and cybernetics deals with the self controlling machine. Modern control theory has its goal to design the system that maximize an objective function overtime. This roughly match the AI view: designing system that behave optimally.
Ktesibios of Alexandria (c. 250 BCE) built the first self-controlling machine: a water clock with a regulator that maintained a constant flow rate.
Modern control theory, especially the branch known as stochastic optimal control, has as its goal the design of systems that maximize a cost function over time.
This roughly matches the standard model of AI: designing systems that behave optimally.

Linguistics
How does language relate to thought?
Language is directly related to thought. Modern linguistics and AI, were born at about the same time and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing.
In 1957, B. F. Skinner published Verbal Behavior,the linguist Noam Chomsky, who had just published a book on his own theory, Syntactic Structures. Modern linguistics and AI, then, were “born” at about the same time, and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing. The problem of understanding language turned out to be considerably more complex than it seemed in 1957. Understanding language requires an understanding of the subject matter and context, not just an understanding of the structure of sentences. This might seem obvious, but it was not widely appreciated until the 1960s. Much of the early work in knowledge representation was tied to language and informed by research in linguistics, which was connected in turn to decades of work on the philosophical analysis of language.
